# Feature Specification: Dark Mode

**Feature Branch**: `015-dark-mode`  
**Created**: 2025-11-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Build a Dark Mode feature for Family Finance that provides persistent dark color scheme, theme toggle in header, user preference persistence in Supabase, system theme detection, and smooth transition animations"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Toggle Between Light and Dark Themes (Priority: P1)

Maria uses the Family Finance app frequently in the evening after work to check her family's cashflow. The bright white interface strains her eyes in low-light conditions. She wants to switch to a dark color scheme for comfortable viewing.

**Why this priority**: Core feature functionality - without the ability to toggle themes, the entire feature has no value. This is the primary interaction users will have with dark mode.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking the theme toggle in the header and observing the entire UI change to dark colors. Delivers immediate value by reducing eye strain.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Maria is on any authenticated page (Dashboard or Gerenciar), **When** she clicks the theme toggle in the header, **Then** the entire interface switches to dark mode with dark backgrounds and light text
2. **Given** Maria is using dark mode, **When** she clicks the theme toggle again, **Then** the interface switches back to light mode
3. **Given** Maria is using any theme, **When** she navigates between pages, **Then** the selected theme persists across navigation
4. **Given** Maria is viewing any component (cards, charts, forms, buttons), **When** she switches themes, **Then** all components adapt their colors appropriately

### User Story 2 - Theme Preference Syncs Across Devices (Priority: P2)

João, Maria's husband, prefers dark mode on his phone but uses the family computer during the day. He wants his dark mode preference to be remembered when he logs in on different devices.

**Why this priority**: Essential for the multi-user family context. Without persistence, users would need to manually toggle every session, degrading the experience significantly.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting a theme preference on one device, logging out, then logging in on another device and verifying the theme is automatically applied.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** João sets his theme preference to dark mode, **When** he logs out and logs back in on the same device, **Then** dark mode is automatically applied
2. **Given** João sets his theme preference on his phone, **When** he logs in on the family computer, **Then** his dark mode preference is applied automatically
3. **Given** Maria prefers light mode and João prefers dark mode, **When** each logs in with their own account, **Then** each sees their own preferred theme

### User Story 3 - System Theme Detection for New Users (Priority: P3)

Pedro is a new family member who just received an invite to the app. His phone is set to dark mode system-wide. When he first logs in, he expects the app to respect his system preference without manual configuration.

**Why this priority**: Improves first-time user experience by reducing friction. However, users can still manually toggle if the default is wrong, so this is a nice-to-have enhancement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by setting the operating system to dark mode, logging in as a new user (no saved preference), and verifying the app automatically uses dark mode.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Pedro's device is set to dark mode and he has no saved theme preference, **When** he logs in for the first time, **Then** the app displays in dark mode
2. **Given** Pedro's device is set to light mode and he has no saved preference, **When** he logs in for the first time, **Then** the app displays in light mode
3. **Given** Pedro has previously set a theme preference, **When** he logs in, **Then** his saved preference takes precedence over system preference
4. **Given** Pedro's system preference changes while using the app, **When** he has no saved preference, **Then** the app does not automatically switch (only applies on initial load)

### User Story 4 - Smooth Visual Transition (Priority: P4)

Ana, another family member, finds abrupt visual changes jarring. When switching themes, she expects a smooth, polished transition that feels professional and intentional.

**Why this priority**: Polish and user experience refinement. The feature works without smooth transitions, but they significantly improve perceived quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by toggling the theme and observing that colors transition smoothly over a brief duration rather than changing instantly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Ana is on any page, **When** she toggles the theme, **Then** colors transition smoothly over approximately 200-300 milliseconds
2. **Given** Ana toggles the theme rapidly multiple times, **When** the transitions occur, **Then** the interface remains stable without visual glitches
3. **Given** Ana is viewing animated elements (loading spinners, charts), **When** she toggles the theme, **Then** animations continue smoothly during the transition

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user's browser doesn't support `prefers-color-scheme`? The app defaults to light mode.
- What happens when Supabase is temporarily unreachable while saving preference? The preference is saved locally and synced when connection is restored, or the app shows a brief non-blocking error toast.
- What happens when a user clears their browser data? System preference is used until they set a new preference.
- What happens during the brief moment between page load and preference fetch? The app uses system preference (or light mode as ultimate fallback) to prevent flash of incorrect theme.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a theme toggle control accessible from the header on all authenticated pages
- **FR-002**: System MUST support two themes: light mode (current default) and dark mode
- **FR-003**: System MUST apply the selected theme to all UI components including cards, forms, buttons, charts, dialogs, and loading states
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist the user's theme preference in a database table linked to their user account
- **FR-005**: System MUST detect the user's operating system theme preference on initial load when no saved preference exists
- **FR-006**: System MUST display the toggle control with labels in Brazilian Portuguese ("Tema Claro" / "Tema Escuro" or appropriate icon with accessible label)
- **FR-007**: System MUST animate theme transitions smoothly to avoid jarring visual changes
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain WCAG AA color contrast ratios in both light and dark themes
- **FR-009**: System MUST ensure focus states are clearly visible in both themes
- **FR-010**: System MUST preserve the selected theme across page navigation within a session
- **FR-011**: System MUST apply the saved theme preference immediately upon user authentication
- **FR-012**: System MUST gracefully handle the loading state before preference is fetched (no flash of wrong theme)

### Key Entities

- **User Preference**: Represents a user's personal settings, including theme choice. Key attributes: user identifier, theme value (light/dark), last updated timestamp. Related to the authenticated user.
- **Theme**: The visual appearance mode of the application. Values: "light" or "dark". Affects all color variables used throughout the UI.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can toggle between light and dark themes in under 1 second, with visible feedback
- **SC-002**: Theme preference is correctly applied within 500ms of user authentication completing
- **SC-003**: 100% of existing UI components (cards, forms, buttons, charts, dialogs, skeletons) render correctly in both themes
- **SC-004**: All text and interactive elements maintain WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text) in both themes
- **SC-005**: Theme preference syncs correctly across devices for the same user account in 100% of cases
- **SC-006**: New users without saved preferences see the app in their system's preferred theme on first load
- **SC-007**: Theme transitions complete smoothly without visual glitches or layout shifts
