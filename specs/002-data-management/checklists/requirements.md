# Specification Quality Checklist: Core Data Management Layer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-11-26  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items passed validation
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`
- The user provided comprehensive requirements including tech stack details which were appropriately excluded from the spec (implementation details belong in the technical plan)
- Reasonable defaults were applied for:
  - Data validation rules (positive amounts, valid day ranges)
  - Default active status for new projects and expenses
  - Single-user, single-browser assumption
  - Currency handling (local currency, no conversion)
