# PMF (Product-Market Fit) Narrative

## 1. Problem Statement

**The problem:** Dual-income groups with variable income streams (freelancers, contractors, project-based workers) lack visibility into their daily cashflow. They don't know if they'll have enough in their checking account on any given day to cover upcoming expenses, leading to anxiety and reactive money management.

**How people solve it today:** 
- Manual Excel/Google Sheets with day-by-day projections
- Mental math and hoping for the best
- Keeping large buffer in checking "just in case"
- Existing apps like YNAB, Mint, Copilot

**Why current solutions fail:**
- **Spreadsheets**: Work but are tedious to maintain, error-prone, hard to visualize, manual updates
- **Budgeting apps**: Over-engineered for this use case. They want you to categorize every transaction and stick to budgets. Users who have sufficient income don't need budget policing—they need cashflow visibility
- **Mental math**: Doesn't scale with multiple income sources and payment dates
- **Large buffers**: Inefficient use of money that could be invested or used for goals

**[WHY THIS MATTERS: Cashflow anxiety is real even for people with "enough" money. The pain isn't budgeting—it's knowing if you can pay the mortgage on the 15th when Client X might pay on the 10th... or might not]**

## 2. Target Customer Archetype

**Primary persona:** You and your wife—a dual-income group where both partners have project-based or variable income. Combined income is comfortable, but payment timing varies. You don't need to count every penny, but you need to know the money will be there when bills are due.

**Day in their life:** 
- End of month: "Let me update the spreadsheet with this month's credit card total"
- Check the projection: "Looks like we're tight around the 20th... I should move money from savings"
- Decide on surplus: "We have €2K extra this month—invest or save for the trip?"
- Rest of month: Peace of mind (or occasional check-in)

**Where they hang out online:** 
- Not relevant for MVP (building for yourselves)
- Future: Reddit (r/personalfinance, r/freelance), Twitter/X, indie hacker communities

**What they're already paying for:**
- Tricount (expense splitting)
- Banking apps
- Maybe a budgeting app they don't really use

**[WHY THIS MATTERS: Building for yourselves first = you ARE the customer. No need to guess at product-market fit—you'll know immediately if it solves your problem]**

## 3. Value Proposition

**One-liner:** See your next 30 days of cashflow at a glance, with danger warnings before you overdraft.

**Unlike:** Spreadsheets and complex budgeting apps

**We:** Show a simple, visual cashflow projection that accounts for variable income certainty

**So that:** You know exactly when you need to move money from savings, and can confidently allocate surplus to goals

**[EXAMPLE: "Unlike YNAB which wants you to categorize every coffee purchase, Fluxo Certo shows you whether you can pay your mortgage next week—in 30 seconds, once a month"]**

## 4. Competitive Moat

**Initial moat (Day 1):** 
- None needed—building for yourselves
- Speed of iteration (you are the user)

**Moat after 100 customers:** 
- Deep understanding of variable-income cashflow patterns
- Simplicity as a feature (resist feature bloat)
- Word-of-mouth from freelancer/contractor communities

**Moat after 1000 customers:**
- Data insights on cashflow patterns
- Integrations with banks/invoicing tools
- Community and trust

**[WARNING: For MVP, moat doesn't matter. Solve your own problem first. Moat comes from sustained execution and learning]**

## 5. Go-to-Market Strategy

**First 10 customers (name them):**
1. You
2. Your wife
3. (Future: friends/family with similar situation)

**First 100 customers (specific channel):** 
- Not relevant for MVP
- Future: Share on Twitter/X, Reddit, Indie Hackers if product proves valuable

**First 1000 customers (scalable approach):** 
- Not relevant for MVP
- Future: Content marketing around freelancer finances, SEO

**[WHY THIS MATTERS: For MVP, the only "go-to-market" is: does this replace your spreadsheet? If yes, you have product-market fit for an audience of 2]**

## 6. Business Model

**Pricing:** Free (personal use)

**Cost to serve one customer:** $0 (local-first, no server costs)

**Customer acquisition cost:** $0 (building for yourselves)

**Break-even point:** N/A for MVP

**Future considerations (if productized):**
- Freemium: Free for basic, paid for cloud sync/sharing
- One-time purchase: $29-49 lifetime
- Subscription: $5/month for premium features

**[REALITY CHECK: MVP has no business model because it's a personal tool. That's fine—validate the product before validating the business]**
